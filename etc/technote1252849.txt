Tivoli Framework Gateway hung in boot: IBM Technote ID: 1252849

Gateway hung in boot with status=31

Technote (troubleshooting)

Problem(Abstract)

wgateway shows a gateway in "b" status (boot status) and it never
changes with a status=31 message in the gatelog.

See the Cause section for log details identifying this specify hang.
Cause

NAT device between the TMR and Gateway is interfering with IOM communications.

In this case you will see this pair of lines the epmgrlog:

<date><time> 4 0104EC38: gateway_is_booting:
2008126710.1.578#TMF_Gateway::Gateway#
<date><time> 4 0104EC38: iom query 2008126710.1.578 iom key:
169738558I1051If4af78f4af78 algczar

This is what it looks like for a healthy Gateway:

<date><time> 4 0x816a148: gateway_is_booting:
2008126710.1.578#TMF_Gateway::Gateway#
<date><time> 4 0x816a148: iom query 2008126710.1.578 iom key:
3232249987I1024I81e01d081e01d0 algczar
<date><time> 4 0x816a148: iom query done 2008126710.1.578#TMF_Gateway::Gateway#
<date><time> 4 0x816a148: gateway_is_booting: done
2008126710.1.578#TMF_Gateway::Gateway#

There should have been a response to the query almost immediately.


This is what you should look for the gatelog:

<date><time> 5 0038C6F0: boot: get epcache from EpMgr
<date><time> 2 0038C6F0: boot: retry epcache_open 10

<date><time> 0 00F49BC0: ----------- GATEWAY SHUTDOWN CALLED ------------

Resolving the problem

1) On the TMR enter:


odadmin set_allow_NAT TRUE
odadmin set_iom_by_name TRUE 1
odadmin set_iom_by_name TRUE <OD>
odadmin reexec 1
odadmin reexec <OD>

Where <OD> is the object dispatcher number of the gateway. That is,
the middle number of the OID of the Gateway. You can enter "wlookup
-ar Gateway" to see the OIDs of all the Gateways to get the OD.

2) Enter "odadmin" and "odadmin odinfo <OD>" to make sure it says
"ALLOW_NAT = TRUE" and "Perform local hostname lookup for IOM
connections = TRUE" for both the TMR and Gateway.

3) Now stop and restart the Gateway with these commands. This time is
will go from boot status to up status after a short time. The last
command you can use repeatedly to check the status of the gateways.

wgateway <GW> stop
wgateway <GW> start
wgateway
